# Hi there I'm Inzamamul Karim.
I'm a programmer working at [SELISE Digital Platforms](https://selisegroup.com/) as a *Software Engineer*. With nearly seven years of professional experience as a PHP programmer and a strong foundation in Object-Oriented PHP, my career objective is to specialize in the development of low to mid-level scale applications. I am dedicated to crafting these applications with robust technical designs, leveraging my expertise not only in PHP but also in React and Next.js for frontend development, along with CodeIgniter and Laravel frameworks and software design patterns for backend development. I aim to deliver efficient, maintainable, and scalable solutions that meet the evolving needs of businesses and users, while seamlessly integrating modern frontend technologies to create exceptional user experiences.
